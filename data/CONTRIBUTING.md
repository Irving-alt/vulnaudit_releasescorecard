# Contributing

## Baseline rules
- Files under `data/` are baseline inputs for automated evaluation.
- Do NOT modify any existing files under `data/` on feature branches.

## Output rules
- Generated artifacts should be created under `dashboard/` and `.github/workflows/`.
- Keep outputs deterministic and reproducible.
